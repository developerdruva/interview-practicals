# 💼 Interview Practicals Repository

This repository contains a collection of **frontend**, **JavaScript**, and **project-based practicals** completed as part of technical interview exercises and internal assessments.  
It showcases my ability to solve real-world coding problems, design UI components, and build structured, reusable solutions across different stacks.

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Tools

| Category | Tools & Frameworks |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React (in some tasks) |

## 💡 Highlights

- Solved multiple **JavaScript logical problems** (loops, array methods, async/await, etc.)
- Built **responsive UIs** using HTML and CSS without relying on external frameworks.
- Designed and implemented **real-world coding test solutions** (Wipro, Altimetrik).
- Maintained **modular folder structure** and clean, readable code.

````

### 2. Install dependencies (if applicable)

Some folders (like `alti-internal/`) may contain Node.js projects:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open HTML files directly

For UI assignments under `html/`, simply open them in a browser:

```bash
open html/index.html
```
